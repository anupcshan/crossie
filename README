Crossie
=======

Bunch of scripts used to scrape The Daily Hindu Crossword from their website.
Currently their site does not allow one to try and solve it online.
This program is meant to present the crossie in a form which can be solved on a computer.

How to use
----------
- Run ./crossie yyyy mm dd > matrix.js
		where dd/mm/yyyy is the date of the crossword.
- Open index.html in Chrome. (currently not supported in any other browser,
		requires HTML LocalStorage support)
- Crossword state is maintained across tab/browser closing.
